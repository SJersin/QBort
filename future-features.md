# The *future of QBort* is **HERE!!**

---------------------------------

## Things I have noted to add to the bot

- Have bot DM me when there is an (super for serious y'all) error reported to log?
- More options to be set!! *ALL THE OPTIONS!!*\*
  - *Not all options available to be set.
- Add an "AFK" mode for mods and users.
  - Allow for players to quickly change their active status.
- Auto-guild registration? Display something or another?
- Setting to switch bot between random order fair pull (current default) and the old bot's traditional FIFO by reaction.

### I need to do these first

1. Figure out why the queue management breaks after connection reset.
2. Add parameter / functionality to New/Open command to allow for game specification.
    - Allow for game name to be passed after role.
    - I'll think of other uses for it while I'm fighting with it.

## The **[Admin]** command

### Will function as a CLI style command

- Pass switch parameters and values
- Parse multiple switch parameters.
- Might restrict this to an actual role granting permission to use it.
  - *That way Lt. McNew Mod doesn't accidentally the everything...*

#### Let me know if there are any features *you* want to see
